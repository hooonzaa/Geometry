          <h5 class="card-title">Zoink</h5>
          <p class="card-text" >Zoink (formerly Z01nk, zZoink in-game) is a skilled American player in Geometry Dash. Credited to him beating the hardest Extreme Demons in the game in very short amounts of time, combined with the consistently low attempt counts he spends completing such levels, he is considered by many to be the best player in the game. He is well known for being the first victor of Slaughterhouse.[2] On August 23, 2022, he verified his own buffed version of Riot's mega-collaboration Acheron after 72,808 attempts.[3] It dethroned Slaughterhouse as the new Top 1 on the Demonlist on October 7, 2022, after a small drama due to its initial placement at #2.

          Zoink became the second player after nSwish to have ever completed the entire Top 75 hardest Demons on the Demonlist at some point following his completion of The Art of the Blade on April 23, 2023.
          
          On September 9, 2023, he verified the Top 1-difficulty level Tidal Wave after 49,534 attempts. This achievement made Zoink the first-ever player to verify the Top 3 concurrent hardest levels in the game, the other levels being Acheron and Avernus.
          
          As of January 13, 2023, Zoink is currently the #1 player on the Pointercrate Individual Stats Viewer.</p>
